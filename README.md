### what are VSCode snippets?

> Code snippets are templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.
>
> In Visual Studio Code, snippets appear in IntelliSense (âŒƒSpace (Windows, Linux Ctrl+Space)) mixed with other suggestions, as well as in a dedicated snippet picker (Insert Snippet in the Command Palette). There is also support for tab-completion: Enable it with "editor.tabCompletion": "on", type a snippet prefix (trigger text), and press Tab to insert a snippet.
